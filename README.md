# Laboratory-Exercise-3.2-

Problem:
In the previous assignment, you have created a library management system. This time, you brainstorm with your groupmates and conceptualize a Java project that can be driven by the array, ArrayList, and stack. The application should also apply any of the following sorting algorithms. Select a sorting algorithm that could optimize the process. Justify your choice of sorting algorithm.
Application of Data Structures:
Array: Must be used in part of the application where fixed-size data structures are appropriate (e.g., storing a fixed set of items).
ArrayList: Should be used where a resizable data structure is more suitable (e.g., dynamic lists of objects or records).
Stack: Incorporate stack operations (e.g., push, pop) in the project to simulate real-life stack behavior (e.g., undo operations, last-in-first-out data retrieval).
Sorting Algorithm:
Implement one of the following sorting algorithms to optimize the process within your application:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Shell Sort
Heap Sort
Choose a sorting algorithm based on the specific requirements of your project (e.g., sorting records, items, or tasks).
